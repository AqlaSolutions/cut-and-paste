[mod-setting-description]
cut-and-paste-replace-mode=Specify what to do with conflicting entities when force-pasting a copy/cut blueprint.\n\nWhen different:\nDeconstruct destination entity if it's a different entity or if it is pointing in a different direction.\nNote that this won't modify the destination entity excepts for adding circuit wires.\n\nAlways:\nConflicting entities are always desconstructed even if they are of the same type (the wiring will also be maintained if they're of the same type).\n\nNever: conflicting entities are never deconstructed (this doesn't apply to trees which are always deconstructed by the game when force-placing blueprints).
cut-and-paste-reuse-copy-blueprint=If enabled, you'll be able to reuse the blueprint generated by the __ITEM__cut-and-paste-tool-copy__. These blueprints differ from vanilla blueprints in the way colliding items get replaced when force-placing them.\n\nWhen this is disabled they can only be used when in the player's hand and are automatically converted back to their original tool form when stored in inventory.
cut-and-paste-reconnect-wires=If enabled, circuit connections from outside the cut selection will be relinked to the pasted entities if they're not too far.
cut-and-paste-keep-tiles=If enabled, the tiles selected with the __ITEM__cut-and-paste-tool-cut__ will only be copied to the destination, not moved.
cut-and-paste-move-items=If enabled, items in containers (chest contents, turret ammo, furnace fuel, ...) will be also be moved to the destination. Modules are always moved regardless of this setting.
